# Wave API Endpoints

This repo contains the API Endpoints for [Laravel Wave](https://wave.devdojo.com).

## How to Use

You'll need to download the free [Insomnia API REST Client](https://insomnia.rest/app/account/). Once you have downloaded and installed you will need to import the `wav-api-endpoints.json` file from this repo.

To import click on the arrow next to the Insomnia Text on the top left. Click on **Import/Export**

Then click **Import Data -> From File** and select the `wave-api-endpoints.json`

You will now see all the available endpoints that can be accessed.

> Note, you may wish to change the `base_url` variable. By default it is set to http://wave.test, but you can click on that variable and change it to be the URL where you have installed the Wave App.
